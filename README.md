# Perlin Noise Fire and Smoke Animation

## Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of realistic fire and smoke effects using **Perlin Noise** in **C++** with **OpenGL**. The procedural animation showcases dynamic behavior, making it suitable for real-time simulations or visual effects in games.

---

## Features
- **Procedural Fire and Smoke Effects**: Realistic and smooth animations generated using Perlin Noise.
- **OpenGL Visualization**: Real-time rendering with interactive performance.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Easily tweak parameters to modify fire and smoke intensity or behavior.

---

## Requirements
- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a compatible C++ compiler installed (e.g., MSVC, GCC).  
- **OpenGL**: Make sure OpenGL libraries are set up in your development environment.  
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio is recommended for building the project.
